> a relational language implemented in node

when i learned about programming paradigms, my engineering world burst
wide open. a paradigmatic approach to programming is key to avoiding dogma
and choosing the right tool for the job.

this repository contains code that implements a relational language in node,
based on a post by @jcolgan, http://codon.com/hello-declarative-world.

it's true that @jlcogan has [already implemented this in ES6][1], but i'd like to
do it myself to learn more.
