> a relational language implemented in node

[![travis badge](https://travis-ci.org/ashleygwilliams/relational-node.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/ashleygwilliams/relational-node)

when i learned about programming paradigms, my engineering world burst
wide open. a paradigmatic approach to programming is key to avoiding dogma
and choosing the right tool for the job.

this repository contains code that implements a relational language in node,
based on a post by [@tomstuart][2], http://codon.com/hello-declarative-world.

it's true that [@jcoglan][2] has [already implemented this in ES6][1], but i'd like to
do it myself to learn more.
